# LSTM_time_series

Originally a colab notebook with tesorflow (the code for which I can supply if requested). I used a Kaggle wind speed dataset for a deep neural network prediciton model. Optimizing hyperparameters and refactoring the current code are obviously necessary, but one can see that the model learned the general trend of this time series, with good predictive performance.
